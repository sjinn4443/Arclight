# Project Brief

<!-- APP-DOC-STATUS:START -->

## Current Memory Status (18/5/2026)

- Static packaging: open `index.html` directly; a local HTTP server is optional for testing.
- Mobile target: `360 x 740`, with the main page kept free of required vertical scrolling.
- Shared appbar: `54px` high; `Quicksand` `25px`/`700` title; `44 x 44` burger and info buttons set `12px` from the edges.
- Burger glyph: shared CSS three-bar mark, `18px` wide with `2px` strokes, so no app depends on a bold font glyph.
- Shared side menu: left drawer under the appbar; `min(76vw, 284px)` width; `16px` padding; pale `#f8fbff` surface; blue-grey border; card-style actions with small level dots.
- Appbar content colour: bright green `#00ff3b` on a black appbar.
- Favicon: current black-square app favicon with the app letter or letters centred.

Deliver a lightweight, one-page glaucoma risk calculator that is:

- fast on mobile,
- simple to use at point-of-care,
- transparent in how scores are derived,
- safe to maintain through modular logic and testable core calculations.

Current brief additions:

- Keep scoring and threshold rules visible in-app via the app-bar info popup.
- Treat `Rock` palpation as an explicit acute warning state.
