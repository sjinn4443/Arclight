## Project Structure

- `index.html` - Main entry point of the app
- `style.css` - Global styles
- `js/` - JavaScript files for different modules and features
- `images/` - Image assets used throughout the app
- `memory-bank/` - Documentation and project context files
- Various folders for specific modules like `AnteriorSegmentQuiz`, `Cataract`, `Morph`, `Squint`, etc.

## Memory Bank

The `memory-bank/` directory contains essential project documentation that guides development and maintains project knowledge. It includes:

- `projectbrief.md` - Core project requirements and goals
- `productContext.md` - User experience and problem context
- `activeContext.md` - Current work focus and recent changes
- `systemPatterns.md` - Architecture and design patterns
- `techContext.md` - Technologies and development setup
