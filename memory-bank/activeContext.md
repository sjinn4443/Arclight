# Active Context

## Current Work Focus

The current focus is on ensuring the application's core structure and PWA capabilities are robust, including proper service worker registration and update mechanisms, and a comprehensive navigation system.

## Recent Changes

- Configured VS Code launch settings by creating `.vscode/launch.json` to enable easy debugging and running of the application on `http://localhost:3000`.
- Implemented logic in `script.js` to prompt users to refresh the page when a new service worker version is detected, ensuring they always access the latest application version.
- Enhanced the navigation system to include a unified dashboard, language/install page, onboarding, and professional interest pages, along with detailed module pages for Eyes and Ears content.
- Integrated a "My Learning" (Liked) page with masonry layout and search functionality.
- Developed a dynamic Table of Contents (TOC) for the "Atoms Card" section, supporting both Eyes and Ears content with image display and zoom functionality.
- Implemented a quiz system for "Direct Ophthalmoscopy" and "Anterior Segment Quiz" modules.
- Added video players with time-based event handling and interactive toolbars for various learning modules.
- Introduced an offline content management modal to allow users to select and download specific assets for offline use.
- Updated the `README.md` file to include a changelog section with dates and descriptions of recent changes.

## Next Steps

- Continue populating all educational modules with comprehensive content (text, images, videos, quizzes).
- Refine interactive elements within quizzes and case studies for a more engaging user experience.
- Implement robust client-side error handling and enhance accessibility features across the application.
- Expand automated tests to cover new features, edge cases, and error handling.
- Further optimize media loading and overall application performance.
- Establish a clear deployment pipeline for different environments (dev, test, prod).

## Active Decisions and Considerations

- Maintaining a modular design for easy expansion and maintenance of educational content.
- Prioritizing PWA features for offline accessibility, crucial for target audiences in low-connectivity environments.
- Ensuring a consistent and intuitive user experience across all new pages and features.
- Continuously updating and refining the memory bank to accurately reflect project status and technical details.

## Important Patterns and Preferences

- Adherence to the specified memory bank structure and content guidelines.
- Prioritizing clear and concise documentation.
- Using vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to keep the codebase lightweight and maintainable.
- Implementing a component-based approach for UI elements where appropriate (e.g., module cards, quiz blocks).

## Learnings and Project Insights

- The project has evolved into a feature-rich PWA with a strong emphasis on interactive learning and offline capabilities.
- The modular structure has proven effective for integrating diverse content types (videos, quizzes, simulations).
- The importance of a robust service worker update mechanism for PWAs to ensure users always have the latest version.
- The application's complexity has increased, necessitating careful management of global state and event listeners.
