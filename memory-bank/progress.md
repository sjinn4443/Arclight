# Progress

## What Works

- **Core Application Structure:** The main `index.html` and module directories are in place, supporting a comprehensive PWA.
- **Advanced Navigation:** A unified dashboard, language/install page, onboarding, professional interest pages, and detailed module pages for Eyes and Ears are fully functional.
- **PWA Setup:** `manifest.json` and `service-worker.js` are present, with robust service worker registration and an update prompt mechanism implemented in `script.js`.
- **Content Organization:** Images and videos are organized in dedicated directories and dynamically loaded.
- **Module-specific content:** Each module (e.g., AnteriorSegmentQuiz, Cataract) has its own HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files, providing self-contained functionality.
- **VS Code Launch Configuration:** A `launch.json` file has been created to easily run the application locally for debugging.
- **"My Learning" (Liked) Page:** Features a masonry layout, search functionality, and persistent "like" state for modules.
- **Atoms Card with Dynamic TOC:** The "Atoms Card" section includes a dynamic Table of Contents for both Eyes and Ears, with image display and zoom capabilities.
- **Quiz System:** Implemented for "Direct Ophthalmoscopy" and "Anterior Segment Quiz" modules, providing interactive learning and feedback.
- **Video Players with Interactive Toolbars:** Various learning modules feature video players with time-based event handling and interactive toolbars for various learning modules.
- **Offline Content Management:** A modal allows users to select and download specific assets for offline use via the service worker.
- **General Application Refinement:** Ongoing improvements and content integration across various modules, including updates to video playback, navigation, onboarding, and PWA features.

## What's Left to Build

- **Full Content Population:** Ensure all educational modules are fully populated with comprehensive content (text, images, videos, quizzes).
- **Interactive Elements:** Refine all interactive elements within quizzes and case studies for a more engaging user experience.
- **Robust Error Handling:** Implement client-side error handling for a smoother user experience across all new features.
- **Accessibility Features:** Enhance accessibility (ARIA attributes, keyboard navigation, etc.) across the application, especially for new interactive components.
- **Testing:** While a comprehensive test suite is in place, continue to develop and expand automated tests for new features, edge cases, error handling, and PWA functionalities. Keep tests in sync with the codebase.
- **Performance Optimization:** Further optimize media loading and overall application performance, particularly with the increased content and dynamic elements.
- **Deployment Pipeline:** Establish a clear deployment process for different environments (dev, test, prod).

## Current Status

The project has significantly advanced beyond its initial setup phase. The foundational structure is robust, and many core features, including advanced navigation, PWA capabilities, interactive learning modules, and content management, are now implemented. The application is a feature-rich PWA with a strong emphasis on interactive learning and offline capabilities. The README.md file has been updated to include a changelog. Recent work on 2025-08-30 involved general application refinement and content integration across various modules. The next steps involve completing content population, refining existing features, and ensuring comprehensive testing and optimization.

## Known Issues

- The application might not immediately show the latest version due to browser caching of the service worker, even with the new update prompt. Users may still need to manually clear site data or perform a hard refresh if the prompt doesn't appear or is dismissed.
- Some placeholder content still exists and needs to be replaced with actual educational material.
- The "Coming Soon" pages need to be fully developed.

## Evolution of Project Decisions

- The decision to use a PWA-first approach was made early and has been consistently reinforced, leading to the implementation of advanced offline features.
- The modular design has proven highly effective for integrating diverse and expanding educational content.
- The preference for vanilla JavaScript has been maintained, but the complexity of the application has led to more structured JavaScript patterns and global state management.
- The project has embraced a more interactive and user-centric design, incorporating features like the "My Learning" page and dynamic TOCs to enhance the learning experience.
